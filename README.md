# Network Analysis: Assignment 2

Second assignment of the network analysis course

## Part 1

For the first part of the assignment we performed the experiments of the option number 1, which plans to perform robustness test on small graph. </br>
We have choosen two kind of graphs:

-  The second
</br></br>




### Karate Club Graph
The first, showed in *figure 1*, is the already known **Zachary’s Karate Club** graph, which is a social network of a university karate club. This network is composed by 34 nodes ( member of a karate club ), and there are links between pairs of members who interacted outside the club.

We performed the same experiments on the Facebook dataset we already used in the first assignment.
